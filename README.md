# LogiChain
Supply chain logistics refers to the detailed processes required to create and ship a product; supply chains are facilitated through a company, its suppliers, eventually the customer and any other potential essential members of the network.
In essence, a supply chain is the description of a networkâ€™s movement of supplies to a company - one or many - which then creates a product and ships it to an endpoint (i.e. a customer).

The traditional model of a supply chain is inefficient. this is due to the time it takes to transfer information from node to node, but with the new technology that the last few decades have produced, there are many optimazations to be made in these systems.
One of the more promising technoligies able to streamline supply chain preformance is blockchain, blockchain is useful for scalable, uniform and instantaneous* data sharing. Not only this, but blockchain is based around de-centralized, transparent and ultimately trustworthy systems, this is perfect for money driven networks like supply chains; everyone is on the same page and everyone profits.
