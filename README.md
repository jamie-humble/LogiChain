# LogiChain
Supply chain logistics refers to the detailed processes required to create and ship a product; supply chains are facilitated through a company, its suppliers, eventually the customer and any other potential essential members of the network.
In essence, a supply chain is the description of a network’s movement of supplies to a company - one or many - which then creates a product and ships it to an endpoint (i.e. a customer).
